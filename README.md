A popular social media platform dedicated to food enthusiasts wants to improve user engagement by adding advanced image recognition features. As a machine learning engineer, you are tasked with developing a food image classification system using Hugging Face's state-of-the-art models. This system will automatically identify and categorize food items in user-uploaded photos, allowing for better content organization and personalized food content recommendations.

Your responsibility is to develop a robust food category image classification system using pre-trained models from Hugging Face.

The goal is to enhance user interaction by providing accurate food classification, enabling users to easily find and engage with content related to their favorite foods, and improving the overall experience on the platform.

In this dynamic project, we leverage the power of PyTorch and transformers, utilizing an open-source model from Hugging Face as the backbone of our solution.
